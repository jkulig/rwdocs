For bundle products we reuse the simple products which are used in configurable products. That's why to upload an image for a bundle version of the product it has to be uploaded in Magento for a Bundle Image role. Here we assume that products you want to upload image to are already imported into Magento. So to upload bundle images:
1. Login into Magento backend
2. Go to `Products > Catalog`
